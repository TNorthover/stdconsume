# p0750r0 consume

## Background

Memory order consume as specified in C++11 hasn't been implemented by any
compiler. The main reason for this shortcoming is that the specification creates
a fundamental mismatch between the model of "dependency" at the C++ source code
level and "dependency" at the ISA-specific assembly level. The goal of consume
was to expose what ARM calls the "address dependency rule" as explained in
section 6.3 of [the ARM Barrier Litmus Tests and
Cookbook](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.genc007826/Barrier_Litmus_Tests_and_Cookbook_A08.pdf). POWER
has a similar ISA feature. On ISAs such as ARM and POWER consume allows writing
release / acquire style code, where the reader side doesn't need extra
fences. Ordering is guaranteed by creating dependencies on the reader side
between the released location and the subsequent reads that should be observed
to happen after that location's value was written by the writer. A "dependency"
at the ISA level means that computation of the value of the address of
subsequent loads depend on the value loaded from the release location.

Despite not being implemented by any C++11 compiler, consume-style code is
widely used in software. The best known example of such usage is Linux's [Read
Copy Update](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/RCU/whatisRCU.txt). To
maintain correctness, these uses rely on:

  - A gentleperson's agreement with compiler authors to avoid breaking code;
  - Human inspection of compiled code disassembly;
  - Extensive testing;
  - Judicious application of inline assembly; and
  - Luck üçÄ.

This proposal continuing work from:

  - [Proposal for New memory order consume Definition](http://wg21.link/p0190r3)
  - [Marking memory order consume Dependency Chains](https://wg21.link/p0462r1)

It is different from prior proposals in that it contains a single proposed API,
which is known to work for at least one code base. Indeed, it is based on [work
in
WebKit](https://trac.webkit.org/browser/webkit/trunk/Source/WTF/wtf/Atomics.h?rev=+217722#L342)
which has been successfully using consume ordering in C++ on ARM platforms for a
while.

The proposed API for C++ is substantially different from the WebKit API:

 - The proposal has fewer sharp edges than the WebKit one; and
 - The proposal attempts to support more usecases as documented by p0462r1


## Wording as of C++17

<blockquote>
    ‚ù°7 An evaluation A carries a dependency to an evaluation B if

    <ol>
    <li>the value of A is used as an operand of B, unless:
    <ol>
        <li>B is an invocation of any specialization of `std::kill_dependency`, or
        <li>A is the left operand of a built-in logical AND `&&` or logical OR `||` operator, or
        <li>A is the left operand of a conditional `?:` operator, or
        <li>A is the left operand of the built-in comma `,` operator; or
    </ol>
    <li>A writes a scalar object or bit-field M, B reads the value written by A from M, and A is sequenced before B, or
    <li>for some evaluation X, A carries a dependency to X, and X carries a dependency to B.
    </ol>

    [ Note: ‚ÄúCarries a dependency to‚Äù is a subset of ‚Äúis sequenced before‚Äù, and
      is similarly strictly intra-thread. ‚Äî end note ]

    ‚ù°8 An evaluation A is dependency-ordered before an evaluation B if

    <ol>
    <li>A performs a release operation on an atomic object M, and, in another
        thread, B performs a consume operation on M and reads a value written
        by any side effect in the release sequence headed by A, or
    <li>for some evaluation X, A is dependency-ordered before X and X carries
        a dependency to B.
    </ol>

    [ Note: The relation ‚Äúis dependency-ordered before‚Äù is analogous to
      ‚Äúsynchronizes with‚Äù, but uses release/consume in place of release/acquire.
      ‚Äî end note ]
</blockquote>

The above wording and subsequent uses of it terms likely need to be updated.


## Other considerations

The following can also be considered as part of this proposal:

  1. Deprecate passing `memory_order_consume` to the existing variable functions.
  2. Make atomic ordering a template parameter tag instead of a variable. This
     would be a huge change, maybe we should do it separately, but it would
     simplify this proposal if we had it.
  3. Deprecate attribute `[[carries_dependency]]`.

The author is happy to add these to the current proposal if SG1 thinks it would
be useful to explore these.


## Future work

The current proposal has a rough API, very rough wording, and a small number of
tests. More work needs to go towards these items. Furthermore, the following
operations need to be added:

  - xchg
  - cmpxchg
  - RMW

It seems like the easiest way to go about is to try out the API in a
from-scratch C++ codebase. An obvious candidate would be a user-space RCU
implementation in C++ using this API.
